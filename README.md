## Project Overview

Random vibration occurs throughout a dataâ€‘center hardware lifecycle â€” during rack assembly/integration, air/road/sea transport, warehouse handling, rack installation, and ongoing operation. **Open Random Vibration Testing of OTS DC Hardware** provides freely available methods, results, datasets, and analysis notes so that anyone can reproduce, validate, or implement state of the art random vibration testing of servers, racks, power units, and associated subsystems.

> **Goals**
>
> - Accelerate improvements in mechanical robustness and sustainable packaging of latest microelectronics and data center hardware.
> - Reduce qualification cost & time by sharing reproducible test procedures and best practices.
> - Improve quality and meaningfulness of test results.
> - Publish realâ€‘world vibration conditions captured from logistics chains.
> - Publish failure modes and stress limits of common data center hardware and components.
> - Foster collaboration among suppliers, OEMs, hyperscale operators, test labs, and academia.
